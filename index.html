				<h1>Welcome</h1>
				<div class="widecontent">Welcome to my new and improved website! My old one was rather outdated and all round pretty terrible,
				so I've started again from scratch to create something that looks and works well. I'd like to thank 
				<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/jokebookservice1">jokebookservice1</a> and
				<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TheScratchHobbiest">TheScratchHobbiest</a> for some of their code I, erm, borrowed...</div>
				<br />
				<div class="widecontent">Anyway, moving swiftly on, on my website you will find many interesting things such as past, present and future projects,
				various things I make, and some stuff about me! I'm sure most of you will be able to use my website,
				but for those that don't know how - use the navigation bar at the top of this page to select the page you want to look at!</div>
				<br />
				<div class="widecontent">I'd also like to thank <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Saiid/">Saiid</a> for their contributions :)</div>
