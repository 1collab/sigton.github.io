				<h3>Instructions and Description</h3>
				<div class="widecontent">
					Stealth is a difficult platforming game, are you good enough to beat it?<br /><br />
					It's split into two parts: Inflitration and Escape.<br />
					You need to break into the facility, plant the bombs, then get out again as fast as you can.<br /><br />
					How to Play<br /><br />
					Arrows keys or W, A, S and D to move the player.<br />
					press space to activate keypads.<br /><br />
					Press P to pause the game<br /><br />
					Get to the right of the screen on each level without being caught by the guards' torches, then in the second part you need to get across without losing all your health!

				<h3>Notes and Credits</h3><br />
				<div class="widecontent">
					All coding was done by me, as well as all of the artwork with the only exception being the explosion gif.<br /><br />
					Sounds:<br />
					Menu music is "I'm Here" by Puppet and Foria, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/monstercat/puppet-foria-im-here">check it out on SoundCloud</a>.<br /><br />
					In-game music are various pieces from the game by Valve, Portal 2.<br />
					Some sound effects are also from Portal 2.<br /><br />
					A couple of the sound effects are edited versions of sounds from the scratch library. The remainder of sound effects are from <a href="https://http://soundbible.com/">soundbible.com</a>.<br /><br />
					Narration was done by <a href="https://www.text2speech.org">www.text2speech.org</a>.<br /><br />
					Other Help:<br />
					<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/RiceParadox/">RiceParadox</a> inspired me for the original idea, when we were talking in a really boring class...<br /><br />
					<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ZLGames/">ZLGames</a> tested it out in various stages, and just generally was there whenever I needed a second opinion on something.<br /><br />
					Software<br /><br />
					The project was made in the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/create/">Scratch online editor</a>.<br />
					All the graphics were made in <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.<br />
					To edit sound effects I used <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>.<br /><br />
					New Version<br /><br />
					Since this one has been finished, I have began working on a new version coded in Python. This is in development, but will eventually supersede this version. Take a look (and contribute) <a href="https://github.com/Sigton/stealth/">here</a>.
