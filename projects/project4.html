				<h3>Instructions and Description</h3>
				<div class="widecontent">
					Stealth is a difficult platforming game, are you good enough to beat it?<br /><br />
					It's split into two parts: Inflitration and Escape.<br />
					You need to break into the facility, plant the bombs, then get out again as fast as you can.<br /><br />
					How to Play<br /><br />
					Arrows keys or W, A, S and D to move the player.<br />
					press space to activate keypads.<br /><br />
					Press P to pause the game<br /><br />
					Get to the right of the screen on each level without being caught by the guards' torches, then in the second part you need to get across without losing all your health!
